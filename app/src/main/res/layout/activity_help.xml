These grave problems are to be put to an end."

To name few of them, the great personality Medicine Baba finds our first mention, whose toil for saving people was set in the period where technology wasn’t easy to access and his sincere effort helped many. His recognition of our effort means a lot to us. Followed by, we are linking with various NGOs like Udham Emergency Blood Donation, Serve Humanity Serve God, Almighty Blessing, Karamyog, India Blood, blood banks, hospitals and many more, who are involved in the blood donation and mass movements related to awareness of blood donation to reach out to the masses at large. Our effort is not only restricted to provide an application to let the voluntary blood donation to occur easily but is also extended to spread awareness among the public so as to increase the count of donors. It’s a non-profiteering initiative with no motive to cash on it but rather to show – we care for every precious life on earth."
